# Smart Task Manager with Priority Sorting  
## statement.md

## Problem Statement  
Managing tasks effectively is a common challenge for students, professionals, and anyone handling multiple responsibilities. People often rely on memory, scattered notes, or phone reminders, which quickly become unorganized and unreliable. Without a structured system, users fail to prioritize important tasks or keep track of deadlines, leading to delays and reduced productivity.  
The project aims to solve this issue by creating a simple and efficient Java console application that allows users to store, organize, and prioritize their tasks based on urgency and due date.

## Scope of the Project  
The scope of this project includes designing and implementing a command-line task management system using Core Java. The system supports adding tasks, viewing tasks in sorted order, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and saving all information permanently using text-based storage.  
The project focuses on demonstrating modular design, object-oriented programming, file handling, custom sorting techniques, and user interaction through a console interface. Advanced features like GUI, database integration, or notifications fall outside the current scope but may be considered as future enhancements.

## Target Users  
The system is intended for anyone who needs a lightweight and accessible method to manage their daily tasks. This includes:  
- Students managing assignments, submissions, and schedules  
- Working professionals organizing deadlines and work responsibilities  
- Individuals managing personal commitments and routines  
The application requires no special technical knowledge and can be used by beginners, as it runs entirely from the command line and maintains tasks automatically.

## High-Level Features  
- Ability to create tasks with title, description, due date, and priority  
- Automatic sorting of tasks by priority and deadline to highlight urgent work  
- Marking tasks as completed to track progress  
- Deleting tasks that are no longer needed  
- Loading existing tasks at startup and saving them at exit  
- Simple menu-driven console interface for easy navigation  
- Lightweight text-file storage requiring no external database
